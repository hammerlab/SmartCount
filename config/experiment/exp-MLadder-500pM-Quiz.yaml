  # This list should include all fields necessary to identify a specific array.  For example, if an experiment
  # includes the properties "lane" and "concentration" where "lane" corresponds to one of the arrays on a chip
  # with 3 such arrays and concentration to the amount of some drug administered to all apartments in that chip,
  # then this list should be set as [lane, concentration] -- all analysis will then be grouped by these values.
